# Bolt's Journal - Critical Learnings

## 2025-05-19 - Pattern compilation in scope audit
**Learning:** `patternToRegex` in scope-audit parsed and compiled a new RegExp instance on every path evaluation during scope audits.
**Action:** Always cache compiled pattern regexes in a bounded Map when evaluating batch paths against intent globs.

## 2025-05-20 - Precomputed declarations and pattern facts in Intent Map scheduling
**Learning:** `intentSchedulingWave` evaluated subtask conflict pairs by instantiating `new Map` and parsing `patternLiteralPrefix` on every `writeIntentConflictBetween` check, resulting in O(N^2) allocations during wave calculation.
**Action:** Build declarative maps and pre-parse pattern literal prefixes once per scheduling wave before candidate iteration.
