# Bolt's Journal - Critical Learnings

## 2025-05-19 - Pattern compilation in scope audit
**Learning:** `patternToRegex` in scope-audit parsed and compiled a new RegExp instance on every path evaluation during scope audits.
**Action:** Always cache compiled pattern regexes in a bounded Map when evaluating batch paths against intent globs.

## 2025-05-20 - Write-intent conflict detection and wave scheduling
**Learning:** `patternLiteralPrefix` repeatedly performed string splits and regex matching per pair comparison in `writeIntentPatternsMayOverlap`, and `writeIntentConflictBetween` reconstructed a subtask-declarations Map on every pair check within wave scheduling loops.
**Action:** Cache literal prefixes in a bounded Map and pass pre-constructed declarations Maps across batch conflict checks in scheduling loops.
